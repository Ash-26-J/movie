# Movie Recommendation System

A content-based movie recommendation system built with Python, Streamlit, and leveraging the TMDB dataset from Kaggle. This system suggests similar movies based on your selection, complete with posters.

## About

This project implements a movie recommendation system that helps users discover new movies based on their preferences. It utilizes **content-based filtering**, where recommendations are made by finding movies similar in characteristics (e.g., genres, keywords, cast, crew) to a movie selected by the user. The system is deployed as an interactive web application using **Streamlit**.

---

## Features

-   **Interactive Movie Selection:** Users can select a movie from a dropdown list.
-   **Content-Based Recommendations:** Provides recommendations based on the similarity of movie features.
-   **Movie Posters:** Fetches and displays movie posters from The Movie Database (TMDB) API.
-   **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Streamlit for a simple and intuitive user experience.

## Dataset

The core of this recommendation system is built upon the **TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset**, publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-5000-movie-dataset). This dataset contains information on approximately 5000 movies, including their genres, keywords, cast, crew, and plot summaries, which are used to calculate movie similarities.

## How it Works

1.  **Data Preprocessing:** The raw TMDB dataset is processed to extract relevant features (e.g., combining genres, keywords, cast, and crew into a single text representation).
2.  **Vectorization:** A TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorizer or similar technique is applied to convert the text features into numerical vectors.
3.  **Similarity Calculation:** **Cosine similarity** is used to measure the similarity between movie vectors. This results in a similarity matrix where each entry represents the similarity score between two movies.
4.  **Recommendation Logic:** When a user selects a movie, the system identifies its index in the dataset, retrieves its similarity scores from the pre-computed similarity matrix, and then recommends the top N most similar movies (excluding the selected movie itself).
5.  **Poster Fetching:** For each recommended movie, its TMDB `movie_id` is used to query the **TMDB API** and fetch the corresponding movie poster URL.
6.  **Streamlit Interface:** The Streamlit application provides a dropdown for movie selection and displays the recommended movie titles and their posters.

## Installation

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your-username>/movie-recommendation-system.git
    cd movie-recommendation-system
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file yet, create one with the following content and then run the command above:*

    ```
    streamlit
    pandas
    scikit-learn
    requests
    numpy
    ```

4.  **Obtain TMDB API Key:**
    You'll need an API key from The Movie Database (TMDB) to fetch movie posters.
    - Go to [TMDB Developer Website](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).
    - Sign up/Log in and generate a new API key (v3 API).
    - **Important:** Replace `'8265bd1679663a7ea12ac168da84d2e8'` in `app.py` with your actual API key. For better security and deployment, consider setting it as an **environment variable**.

5.  **Prepare Data Files:**
    The application relies on two pre-processed pickle files:
    -   `movie_dict.pkl`: Contains a dictionary that can be converted into a pandas DataFrame, holding movie titles and their `movie_id_y` (which corresponds to the TMDB ID).
    -   `similarity.pkl`: Contains the pre-calculated cosine similarity matrix.

    **Ensure these files are present in the same directory as your `app.py` script.** These files are typically generated by a separate data processing script (e.g., `data_preprocessing.ipynb` or `prepare_data.py`) from the raw Kaggle dataset. If you haven't generated them, you'll need to run that processing step first.

## Usage

Once you have installed the dependencies and prepared the data files, run the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
